# SonarQube Code Review GitLab CI/CD
**You**: how to implement sonarcube code review using gitlab cicd and maven project

**ChatGPT**: Here's a step-by-step guide to implementing SonarQube code review using GitLab CI/CD and a Maven project:

Install SonarQube: You can download and install SonarQube on your own server or use the SonarCloud hosted solution.

Configure SonarQube: After installation, you'll need to configure SonarQube by setting up a database and defining the properties for your analysis. You can refer to the SonarQube documentation for detailed instructions on how to do this.

Connect GitLab and SonarQube: You'll need to integrate GitLab and SonarQube so that GitLab can send information about your code to SonarQube for analysis. To do this, you'll need to create a GitLab personal access token and add it to your SonarQube instance.

Add a .gitlab-ci.yml file: Next, you'll need to add a .gitlab-ci.yml file to your project's root directory to define your CI/CD pipeline. This file will specify the tasks that GitLab should perform whenever a change is pushed to the project's Git repository.

Define the CI/CD pipeline: In your .gitlab-ci.yml file, you'll need to define the CI/CD pipeline that should be executed whenever a change is pushed to the repository. This pipeline should include steps to build the project using Maven, run test cases, and send the code analysis results to SonarQube.

Here's an example of a .gitlab-ci.yml file for a Maven project:yaml
```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - analyze

build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - mvn clean install

test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - mvn test

analyze:
  stage: analyze
  script:
    - mvn sonar:sonar
  environment:
    name: production
  only:
    - master
```

Push the changes to the repository: Finally, push the changes to the Git repository and watch GitLab perform the CI/CD pipeline. The pipeline should build the project, run the test cases, and send the code analysis results to SonarQube.

View the results: You can view the code analysis results in the SonarQube dashboard. This dashboard provides detailed information about your code, including any issues or vulnerabilities that were detected.

Note that this is just a basic example, and you can customize the pipeline as needed for your specific project requirements. Additionally, you may need to update the .gitlab-ci.yml file with environment variables or other settings specific to your project.

**You**: is there any config require in maven project pom.xml?

**ChatGPT**: Yes, you will need to make some configuration changes to your Maven project's pom.xml file in order to use SonarQube for code analysis. Here are the steps to configure your Maven project to use SonarQube:Add the SonarQube Maven plugin to your pom.xml file: You can add the SonarQube Maven plugin to your pom.xml file by adding the following code in the ```&lt;build&gt;``` section of your pom.xml file:php
```php-template
&lt;build&gt;
  &lt;plugins&gt;
    &lt;plugin&gt;
      &lt;groupId&gt;org.sonarsource.scanner.maven&lt;/groupId&gt;
      &lt;artifactId&gt;sonar-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
      &lt;version&gt;3.7.0.1746&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;/plugin&gt;
  &lt;/plugins&gt;
&lt;/build&gt;
```

Note: You should replace ```3.7.0.1746``` with the latest version of the SonarQube Maven plugin.Configure the SonarQube Maven plugin: In the same pom.xml file, you'll need to configure the SonarQube Maven plugin to point to your SonarQube instance. You can do this by adding the following code in the ```&lt;build&gt;``` section of your pom.xml file:php
```php-template
&lt;build&gt;
  &lt;plugins&gt;
    &lt;plugin&gt;
      &lt;groupId&gt;org.sonarsource.scanner.maven&lt;/groupId&gt;
      &lt;artifactId&gt;sonar-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
      &lt;version&gt;3.7.0.1746&lt;/version&gt;
      &lt;executions&gt;
        &lt;execution&gt;
          &lt;id&gt;sonar&lt;/id&gt;
          &lt;goals&gt;
            &lt;goal&gt;sonar&lt;/goal&gt;
          &lt;/goals&gt;
        &lt;/execution&gt;
      &lt;/executions&gt;
      &lt;configuration&gt;
        &lt;sonar.host.url&gt;http://localhost:9000&lt;/sonar.host.url&gt;
        &lt;sonar.login&gt;your-token&lt;/sonar.login&gt;
      &lt;/configuration&gt;
    &lt;/plugin&gt;
  &lt;/plugins&gt;
&lt;/build&gt;
```

Note: Replace ```http://localhost:9000``` with the URL of your SonarQube instance, and replace ```your-token``` with the token that you generated in GitLab for SonarQube.

After making these changes, you can save the pom.xml file and run the following command to start the code analysis:```mvn clean install sonar:sonar
```

This will build your Maven project, run the test cases, and send the code analysis results to SonarQube for analysis. You can view the results in the SonarQube dashboard.
