**You**: do you know Using transporter WagonTransporter with priority -1.0?

--------
**ChatGPT**: I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I need more context to understand what you are referring to when you say "transporter WagonTransporter with priority -1.0."

Could you please provide more information or a specific context about what you are referring to? This will help me provide a more accurate answer to your question.

**You**: do you know maven  Using transporter WagonTransporter with priority -1.0?

--------
**ChatGPT**: Yes, I'm familiar with Apache Maven, which is a build automation tool used primarily for Java projects. The message "Using transporter WagonTransporter with priority -1.0" is a log message that Maven generates during the build process.

In Maven, WagonTransporter is a component that is responsible for transferring artifacts (JARs, POMs, etc.) to and from remote repositories. When you see the message "Using transporter WagonTransporter with priority -1.0", it means that Maven has selected WagonTransporter as the transport mechanism for the current artifact transfer and has assigned it a priority of -1.0.

The priority value determines the order in which Maven will try different transport mechanisms for the artifact transfer. A higher priority value means that Maven will try that transport mechanism first. In this case, a priority of -1.0 means that Maven will use the WagonTransporter as a last resort.

This message is generally not something to be concerned about unless you are experiencing issues with artifact transfers during the build process.

**You**: how can I config this priority?

--------
**ChatGPT**: You can configure the priority of transporters in Maven by modifying the settings.xml file located in the Maven installation directory or in your user's home directory under the .m2 folder.

To set the priority of a transporter, you need to add a configuration section for the transporter in the settings.xml file and set the priority value to the desired value. Here is an example of how to set the priority of the WagonTransporter to a higher value (e.g., 1.0) in the settings.xml file:php
```php-template
&lt;settings&gt;
  &lt;servers&gt;
    &lt;server&gt;
      &lt;id&gt;central&lt;/id&gt;
      &lt;configuration&gt;
        &lt;wagonProvider&gt;httpclient&lt;/wagonProvider&gt;
        &lt;httpConfiguration&gt;
          &lt;all&gt;
            &lt;priority&gt;1.0&lt;/priority&gt;
          &lt;/all&gt;
        &lt;/httpConfiguration&gt;
      &lt;/configuration&gt;
    &lt;/server&gt;
  &lt;/servers&gt;
&lt;/settings&gt;
```

In this example, we're setting the priority for the HTTP transport mechanism to 1.0, which means that it will be tried first. The WagonTransporter is one of the HTTP transport mechanisms that Maven supports, so this will also affect the priority of the WagonTransporter.

Note that different transporters have different configuration options, so you should refer to the documentation for the specific transporter you want to configure to understand how to set its priority.

**You**: then how to config Using connector BasicRepositoryConnector with priority 0.0?

--------
**ChatGPT**: To configure the priority of the ```BasicRepositoryConnector``` in Maven, you can add a configuration for it in the ```settings.xml``` file, as follows:php
```php-template
&lt;settings&gt;
  &lt;servers&gt;
    &lt;server&gt;
      &lt;id&gt;central&lt;/id&gt;
      &lt;configuration&gt;
        &lt;repositoryConnector implementation="org.apache.maven.repository.legacy.connector.BasicRepositoryConnector"&gt;
          &lt;priority&gt;0.0&lt;/priority&gt;
        &lt;/repositoryConnector&gt;
      &lt;/configuration&gt;
    &lt;/server&gt;
  &lt;/servers&gt;
&lt;/settings&gt;
```

In this example, we're setting the priority of the ```BasicRepositoryConnector``` to ```0.0```, which means that it will be tried after any transport mechanisms that have a priority greater than ```0.0```.

Note that the ```repositoryConnector``` configuration block is specific to the ```BasicRepositoryConnector```, and the ```implementation``` attribute specifies the fully-qualified name of the connector class. If you want to configure the priority of a different connector, you'll need to find the appropriate configuration options for that connector in the Maven documentation.

**You**: is there any way to change "https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2" in  Using transporter WagonTransporter with priority -1.0 for https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2?

--------
**ChatGPT**: Yes, you can change the URL of the remote repository in Maven by modifying the POM file of your project or by modifying the settings.xml file. Here's how you can do it in both cases:Modifying the POM file: You can override the URL of the remote repository by adding a ```repositories``` section to your POM file and specifying the URL of the repository you want to use. Here's an example:php
```php-template
&lt;project&gt;
  ...
  &lt;repositories&gt;
    &lt;repository&gt;
      &lt;id&gt;my-repo&lt;/id&gt;
      &lt;url&gt;https://my-repo.example.com/maven2&lt;/url&gt;
    &lt;/repository&gt;
  &lt;/repositories&gt;
  ...
&lt;/project&gt;
```

In this example, we're overriding the URL of the default Maven repository (```https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2```) with a custom URL (```https://my-repo.example.com/maven2```) for the repository with ID ```my-repo```.Modifying the settings.xml file: You can also override the URL of the remote repository by modifying the ```mirrors``` section of your ```settings.xml``` file. Here's an example:php
```php-template
&lt;settings&gt;
  ...
  &lt;mirrors&gt;
    &lt;mirror&gt;
      &lt;id&gt;my-repo-mirror&lt;/id&gt;
      &lt;url&gt;https://my-repo.example.com/maven2&lt;/url&gt;
      &lt;mirrorOf&gt;central&lt;/mirrorOf&gt;
    &lt;/mirror&gt;
  &lt;/mirrors&gt;
  ...
&lt;/settings&gt;
```

In this example, we're overriding the URL of the default Maven repository (```https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2```) with a custom URL (```https://my-repo.example.com/maven2```) by creating a mirror with ID ```my-repo-mirror``` that mirrors the ```central``` repository. This means that any request to the ```central``` repository will be redirected to the custom URL specified in the mirror.

Note that in either case, you will need to make sure that the custom repository you are using has the same artifacts and versions that you need for your project to build correctly.

**You**: is there any way to config maven download timeout?

--------
**ChatGPT**: Yes, you can configure the download timeout for Maven by modifying the ```settings.xml``` file. The ```settings.xml``` file contains global settings that apply to all Maven builds, and it is typically located in the ```.m2``` directory in your home directory.

To configure the download timeout, add a ```timeout``` element inside the ```http``` block of the ```settings.xml``` file. For example, to set the timeout to 30 seconds, you can add the following lines to your ```settings.xml``` file:php
```php-template
&lt;settings&gt;
  ...
  &lt;servers&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/servers&gt;
  &lt;mirrors&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/mirrors&gt;
  &lt;profiles&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/profiles&gt;
  &lt;activeProfiles&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/activeProfiles&gt;
  &lt;proxies&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/proxies&gt;
  &lt;http&gt;
    &lt;timeout&gt;30000&lt;/timeout&gt;
  &lt;/http&gt;
&lt;/settings&gt;
```

In this example, we've added a ```timeout``` element with a value of ```30000``` (30 seconds) inside the ```http``` block.

Note that the ```timeout``` value is in milliseconds, so you should adjust the value to suit your needs. Also, keep in mind that setting a very high timeout may result in builds taking longer to fail in case of connection issues, so it's generally a good idea to keep the timeout value reasonable.
