**You**: show me how to build redis with docker compose then show some practice put and get data with cli command

--------
**ChatGPT**: Sure, I can help you with that. Here are the steps to build Redis with Docker Compose and use it to put and get data using the Redis command-line interface (CLI):

Create a new directory for your project and change into it:bash
```bash
mkdir redis-docker-compose &amp;&amp; cd redis-docker-compose
```

Create a new file called ```docker-compose.yml``` in the project directory with the following contents:yaml
```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  redis:
    image: redis
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"
```

This file specifies that we want to use the Redis Docker image, expose port 6379 (the default Redis port), and map it to the same port on the host machine.

Save the ```docker-compose.yml``` file and run the following command in the project directory to start the Redis container:```docker-compose up -d
```

This command will start the Redis container in detached mode (i.e., in the background) so that you can continue to use your terminal.

To verify that the Redis container is running, you can use the following command:```docker ps
```

This command will list all running containers, and you should see the ```redis``` container listed.

Now that we have a running Redis container, we can use the Redis CLI to put and get data. To do this, you first need to install the Redis CLI on your machine. If you're using a Mac or Linux machine, you can use the following command to install the Redis CLI:sql
```sql
sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install redis-tools
```

If you're using a Windows machine, you can download the Redis CLI from the Redis website.

With the Redis CLI installed, you can use the following command to connect to the Redis container:css
```css
redis-cli -h localhost -p 6379
```

This command will start the Redis CLI and connect to the Redis container using the hostname ```localhost``` and port ```6379``` (the default Redis port).

Once you're connected to the Redis container, you can use the following commands to put and get data:vbnet
```vbnet
# Set a key-value pair
SET mykey "Hello World"

# Get the value of a key
GET mykey
```

These commands will set a key-value pair where the key is ```mykey``` and the value is ```Hello World```, and then get the value of the ```mykey``` key.

That's it! You now know how to build Redis with Docker Compose and use it to put and get data using the Redis CLI.
