# Read Excel File C#
**You**: can you show me how to read excel file data by c# ?

--------
**ChatGPT**: Yes, sure. Here is a sample code to read data from an Excel file using C# and the Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel library:sql
```sql
using System;
using Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel;

namespace ReadExcelFile
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            string filePath = @"C:\sample.xlsx";

            Application excel = new Application();
            Workbook workbook = excel.Workbooks.Open(filePath);
            Worksheet worksheet = workbook.ActiveSheet;
            Range range = worksheet.UsedRange;

            for (int row = 1; row &lt;= range.Rows.Count; row++)
            {
                for (int col = 1; col &lt;= range.Columns.Count; col++)
                {
                    Console.Write(range.Cells[row, col].Value2.ToString() + "\t");
                }
                Console.WriteLine();
            }

            workbook.Close();
            excel.Quit();
        }
    }
}
```

This code uses the Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel library to interact with an Excel file, it opens the file, accesses the active worksheet, and gets the used range. Then it loops through the rows and columns of the used range and writes the values of each cell to the console.

Note: The Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel library requires that Microsoft Office is installed on the machine running the code.

**You**: show me how to convert to a model class have a,b,c properties

--------
**ChatGPT**: Here's a sample code that demonstrates how you can convert the data from an Excel file into a C# model class:csharp
```csharp
using System;
using Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel;

namespace ReadExcelFile
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            string filePath = @"C:\sample.xlsx";

            Application excel = new Application();
            Workbook workbook = excel.Workbooks.Open(filePath);
            Worksheet worksheet = workbook.ActiveSheet;
            Range range = worksheet.UsedRange;

            // Create a list to store the data
            List&lt;MyModel&gt; data = new List&lt;MyModel&gt;();

            for (int row = 2; row &lt;= range.Rows.Count; row++)
            {
                MyModel model = new MyModel();
                model.A = Convert.ToString(range.Cells[row, 1].Value2);
                model.B = Convert.ToString(range.Cells[row, 2].Value2);
                model.C = Convert.ToString(range.Cells[row, 3].Value2);

                data.Add(model);
            }

            workbook.Close();
            excel.Quit();

            foreach (var item in data)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("A: " + item.A + ", B: " + item.B + ", C: " + item.C);
            }
        }
    }

    class MyModel
    {
        public string A { get; set; }
        public string B { get; set; }
        public string C { get; set; }
    }
}
```

In this code, we use a ```List``` to store the data from the Excel file. For each row in the used range, we create an instance of the ```MyModel``` class, populate its properties ```A```, ```B```, and ```C``` with the values from the corresponding cells in the row, and add the instance to the list. Finally, we iterate over the list and print the values of each property of each ```MyModel``` instance.

**You**: then how to export these data to excel file?

--------
**ChatGPT**: To export the data from your C# program to an Excel file, you can use the Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel library as well. Here's a sample code to export the data from a list of ```MyModel``` objects to an Excel file:csharp
```csharp
using System;
using Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel;

namespace ExportToExcelFile
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            List&lt;MyModel&gt; data = new List&lt;MyModel&gt;()
            {
                new MyModel { A = "ValueA1", B = "ValueB1", C = "ValueC1" },
                new MyModel { A = "ValueA2", B = "ValueB2", C = "ValueC2" },
                new MyModel { A = "ValueA3", B = "ValueB3", C = "ValueC3" }
            };

            string filePath = @"C:\sample.xlsx";

            Application excel = new Application();
            Workbook workbook = excel.Workbooks.Add();
            Worksheet worksheet = workbook.ActiveSheet;

            worksheet.Cells[1, 1] = "A";
            worksheet.Cells[1, 2] = "B";
            worksheet.Cells[1, 3] = "C";

            int row = 2;
            foreach (var item in data)
            {
                worksheet.Cells[row, 1] = item.A;
                worksheet.Cells[row, 2] = item.B;
                worksheet.Cells[row, 3] = item.C;
                row++;
            }

            workbook.SaveAs(filePath);
            workbook.Close();
            excel.Quit();
        }
    }

    class MyModel
    {
        public string A { get; set; }
        public string B { get; set; }
        public string C { get; set; }
    }
}
```

This code creates a new instance of the ```Application``` class, adds a new workbook to it, and accesses the active worksheet. Then it sets the values of the first row to "A", "B", and "C" to label the columns. After that, it loops through the list of ```MyModel``` objects and writes the values of the properties ```A```, ```B```, and ```C``` to the corresponding cells in the Excel file. Finally, it saves the workbook to a file and closes it.

**You**: how to implement upload file in asp.net webform  to upload this file

--------
**ChatGPT**: Here's an example of how you can implement a file upload feature in ASP.NET Web Forms using C#:

Create a new ASP.NET Web Forms project in Visual Studio.

Add a new Web Form to the project and name it ```UploadFile.aspx```.

Open the ```UploadFile.aspx``` file and add the following code inside the ```form``` tag:php
```php-template
&lt;asp:FileUpload ID="fileUpload" runat="server" /&gt;
&lt;asp:Button ID="btnUpload" runat="server" Text="Upload" OnClick="btnUpload_Click" /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;asp:Label ID="lblMessage" runat="server" /&gt;
```

This code adds a file upload control, a button, and a label to the form. The file upload control allows users to select a file, and the button is used to trigger the file upload process. The label will be used to display a message indicating the result of the file upload process.Open the code-behind file for the ```UploadFile.aspx``` page and add the following code to the ```UploadFile``` class:csharp
```csharp
protected void btnUpload_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    if (fileUpload.HasFile)
    {
        string fileName = Path.GetFileName(fileUpload.PostedFile.FileName);
        string fileExtension = Path.GetExtension(fileName);
        int fileSize = fileUpload.PostedFile.ContentLength;

        if (fileExtension.ToLower() == ".xlsx" || fileExtension.ToLower() == ".xls")
        {
            string path = Server.MapPath("~/Uploads/") + fileName;
            fileUpload.SaveAs(path);
            lblMessage.Text = "File uploaded successfully.";
        }
        else
        {
            lblMessage.Text = "Please select a valid Excel file (.xlsx or .xls)";
        }
    }
    else
    {
        lblMessage.Text = "Please select a file to upload.";
    }
}
```

This code implements the event handler for the ```Click``` event of the ```btnUpload``` button. When the button is clicked, the code checks if a file has been selected using the ```HasFile``` property of the ```fileUpload``` control. If a file has been selected, it gets the file name, extension, and size, and checks if the file extension is either ```.xlsx``` or ```.xls```. If the file extension is valid, it saves the file to a folder named ```Uploads``` in the root directory of the application using the ```SaveAs``` method of the ```fileUpload``` control. The result of the file upload process is displayed using the ```lblMessage``` label.

In the Solution Explorer, right-click on the project and select "Add" &gt; "New Folder". Name the new folder "Uploads".

Run the project and test the file upload feature by navigating to the ```UploadFile.aspx``` page and selecting a file to upload.

Note: Keep in mind that for security reasons, it's not recommended to directly save uploaded files to the web server's file system. Instead, you should save the uploaded files to a protected location and store a reference to the file in your database.
