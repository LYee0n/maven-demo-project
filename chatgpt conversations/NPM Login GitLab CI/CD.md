# NPM Login GitLab CI/CD
**You**: how to npm login in gitlab cicd

**ChatGPT**: To log in to npm in GitLab CI/CD, you can use the following steps:

Create a personal access token (PAT) in your npm account.

Add the PAT as a secure environment variable in your GitLab project's settings.

In your ```.gitlab-ci.yml``` file, add a command to log in to npm using the PAT:bash
```bash
npm login --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/ --scope=@my-scope
echo "//registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=$NPM_TOKEN" &gt; .npmrc
```

Replace ```@my-scope``` with the scope you want to use and ```NPM_TOKEN``` with the name of the environment variable you created in step 2.

Push your changes to GitLab, and the GitLab CI/CD pipeline will automatically log in to npm during the build process.

**You**: continue

**ChatGPT**: You can then run npm commands as part of your pipeline, such as ```npm install``` or ```npm publish```.

To ensure that your npm packages are secure, you can also configure GitLab to run security scans on your npm dependencies. This can be done by adding the ```node-js-security-audit``` job to your ```.gitlab-ci.yml``` file.

After each build, you can view the results of the security scan in the GitLab pipeline. If any vulnerabilities are detected, you can take appropriate action to fix them.

Remember to keep your PAT secure, as it grants access to your npm account. You should never include the PAT in your code or commit it to your Git repository.

By following these steps, you can easily log in to npm and run npm commands as part of your GitLab CI/CD pipeline. This can help automate your software development and delivery process, ensuring that your packages are always up-to-date and secure.
