# Build K8s Env with Ansible
**You**: how to build k8s enviroment with ansible

**ChatGPT**: Ansible is a powerful automation tool that can be used to manage infrastructure and application deployment. Here are the steps to build a Kubernetes environment with Ansible:

Install Ansible: You will need to have Ansible installed on your control machine. You can install it using a package manager, such as apt or yum, or you can install it using pip.

Create an Inventory file: The next step is to create an inventory file that contains the hostnames or IP addresses of the target machines. You can specify one or more hosts in this file.

Write Ansible Playbooks: Playbooks are the files where you will write your Ansible configuration. They are written in YAML and define the tasks that Ansible should perform on the target machines.

Install Kubernetes packages: The next step is to install the Kubernetes packages on the target machines. You can use the package manager (apt or yum) or use a pre-packaged binary file.

Initialize the Master Node: Once the packages are installed, you will need to initialize the Master Node. This can be done using the kubeadm tool.

Join the Worker Nodes: After the Master Node has been initialized, you can join the Worker Nodes to the cluster using the kubeadm join command.

Deploy Applications: Now that your cluster is up and running, you can deploy your applications using Kubernetes manifests. You can use Ansible to deploy these manifests, or you can use another tool, such as kubectl.

Monitor the Cluster: It is important to monitor your cluster to ensure that it is running smoothly. You can use tools like kubectl, Grafana, and Prometheus to monitor the cluster.

These are the basic steps to build a Kubernetes environment with Ansible. There are many other details to consider, such as configuring networking, security, and storage, but these steps should give you a good starting point.

**You**: can you show me more detail for ansible playbook content?

**ChatGPT**: Certainly! Here's an example Ansible playbook that installs and configures a Kubernetes cluster:yaml
```yaml
- name: Install Kubernetes packages
  hosts: k8s-nodes
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Add Kubernetes repository
      apt_repository:
        repo: deb https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main
        state: present
        update_cache: yes
        
    - name: Install Kubernetes packages
      apt:
        name:
          - kubeadm
          - kubectl
          - kubelet
        state: present
        
- name: Initialize Master Node
  hosts: k8s-master
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Initialize Master Node
      shell: kubeadm init --pod-
```

**You**: continue

**ChatGPT**: network-cidr=10.244.0.0/16 --apiserver-advertise-address={{ ansible_default_ipv4.address }}
register: kubeadm_initbash
```bash
- name: Copy Kubeconfig
  shell: mkdir -p $HOME/.kube &amp;&amp; cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config &amp;&amp; chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
  when: kubeadm_init.rc == 0
```

name: Join Worker Nodes
hosts: k8s-workers
become: yes
tasks:name: Join Worker Nodes
shell: kubeadm join {{ kubeadm_init.stdout_lines[0].split()[-1] }}
when: kubeadm_init.rc == 0

name: Deploy Calico Network Plugin
hosts: k8s-master
become: yes
tasks:name: Apply Calico manifest
shell: kubectl apply -f https://docs.projectcalico.org/manifests/calico.yaml
when: kubeadm_init.rc == 0

name: Check Cluster Status
hosts: k8s-master
become: yes
tasks:

name: Check Cluster Status
shell: kubectl get nodes
register: kubectl_get_nodes
when: kubeadm_init.rc == 0

name: Show Cluster Status
debug:
var: kubectl_get_nodes
when: kubectl_get_nodes.rc == 0vbnet
```vbnet

This playbook performs the following tasks:

1. Adds the Kubernetes repository and installs the Kubernetes packages on all nodes.

2. Initializes the Master Node and copies the Kubeconfig file.

3. Joins the Worker Nodes to the cluster.

4. Deploys the Calico Network Plugin to the cluster.

5. Checks the status of the cluster and outputs the results.

Note that this is just one example of an Ansible playbook for deploying a Kubernetes cluster. There are many different ways to write playbooks, and the exact content will depend on your specific requirements and environment.
