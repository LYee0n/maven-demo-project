**You**: how to start a two hello world child project maven project ?

--------
**ChatGPT**: To start a two hello world child project Maven project, you can follow these general steps:

Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.

Run the following command to create a new Maven project with a specified group ID and artifact ID. Replace ```com.example``` and ```hello-world``` with your desired values:javascript
```javascript
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.example -DartifactId=hello-world -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false
```

This will create a basic Maven project structure with a sample Java class that prints "Hello world!" to the console.Create two child projects by navigating to the root project directory and running the following commands:javascript
```javascript
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.example.child1 -DartifactId=hello-world-child1 -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false

mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.example.child2 -DartifactId=hello-world-child2 -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false
```

These commands will create two new Maven projects with their own group IDs and artifact IDs. Each project will also contain a sample Java class that prints "Hello world!" to the console.

Modify the Java classes in each child project as desired to print a unique message.

Navigate to the root project directory and run the following command to build and package all projects:java
```java
mvn package
```

This will compile the Java classes and create a JAR file for each project.Run the JAR files for each child project to see the messages printed to the console:bash
```bash
java -cp hello-world-child1/target/hello-world-child1-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.child1.App

java -cp hello-world-child2/target/hello-world-child2-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.child2.App
```

This should give you a basic idea of how to create a two hello world child project Maven project. Of course, there are many ways to modify and customize your project based on your specific needs and preferences.
