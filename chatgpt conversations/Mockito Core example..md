**You**: show me Mockito Core example

--------
**ChatGPT**: Sure, here is an example of using Mockito Core to mock a simple class and verify its behavior:

Suppose we have a class ```Calculator``` with a ```calculate``` method that adds two integers and returns the result:java
```java
public class Calculator {
    public int calculate(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

We can use Mockito Core to mock this class and test it in isolation. Here's an example test class:java
```java
import static org.mockito.Mockito.*;
import static org.junit.Assert.*;

import org.junit.Test;

public class CalculatorTest {

    @Test
    public void testCalculate() {
        Calculator calculator = mock(Calculator.class);

        when(calculator.calculate(2, 3)).thenReturn(5);

        int result = calculator.calculate(2, 3);

        verify(calculator).calculate(2, 3);

        assertEquals(5, result);
    }
}
```

In this example, we create a mock ```Calculator``` object using ```mock(Calculator.class)```. We then use the ```when``` method to specify that when the ```calculate``` method is called with arguments 2 and 3, it should return 5.

We then call ```calculator.calculate(2, 3)``` and store the result in ```result```. We use ```verify``` to check that the ```calculate``` method was called with arguments 2 and 3. Finally, we use ```assertEquals``` to check that the result is indeed 5.

This is a simple example, but Mockito Core can be used for more complex scenarios as well. The key idea is to create a mock object, specify its behavior using ```when``` and ```thenReturn```, and then verify that the mock object was used as expected using ```verify```.

**You**: show me Project Lombok example

--------
**ChatGPT**: Sure, here is an example of using Project Lombok to simplify Java code:

Suppose we have a Java class ```Person``` with fields for name, age, and email:java
```java
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;
    private String email;

    public Person(String name, int age, String email) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.email = email;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    public void setAge(int age) {
        this.age = age;
    }

    public String getEmail() {
        return email;
    }

    public void setEmail(String email) {
        this.email = email;
    }
}
```

With Lombok, we can simplify this code by using annotations to generate the getters, setters, and constructor automatically. Here's the same ```Person``` class using Lombok:java
```java
import lombok.AllArgsConstructor;
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.Setter;

@AllArgsConstructor
@Getter @Setter
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;
    private String email;
}
```

In this example, we use the ```@AllArgsConstructor``` annotation to generate a constructor with all fields. We also use the ```@Getter``` and ```@Setter``` annotations to generate getters and setters for all fields.

Now, we can create a ```Person``` object like this:java
```java
Person person = new Person("Alice", 30, "alice@example.com");
```

We can access the fields using the generated getters:java
```java
String name = person.getName();
int age = person.getAge();
String email = person.getEmail();
```

We can also use the generated setters to modify the fields:java
```java
person.setName("Bob");
person.setAge(40);
person.setEmail("bob@example.com");
```

This makes the code much shorter and easier to read. Lombok provides many other annotations that can simplify Java code, including ```@ToString```, ```@EqualsAndHashCode```, and ```@Builder```.
