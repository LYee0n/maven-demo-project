**You**: show me how to build mssql with docker compose

--------
**ChatGPT**: Sure! Here is an example ```docker-compose.yml``` file for setting up a Microsoft SQL Server (MS SQL) container using Docker Compose:yaml
```yaml
version: '3.9'
services:
  db:
    image: mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2019-latest
    ports:
      - "1433:1433"
    environment:
      SA_PASSWORD: "YourStrongPasswordHere"
      ACCEPT_EULA: "Y"
```

This configuration file specifies a single service called ```db``` that runs the MS SQL Server 2019 container image from Microsoft's container registry. The service also maps port ```1433``` in the container to port ```1433``` on the host, so that you can access the database server from your local machine. Finally, the ```environment``` section specifies the SA password and accepts the EULA for the MS SQL Server container.

To start the MS SQL Server container using Docker Compose, run the following command in the directory where you saved the ```docker-compose.yml``` file:```docker-compose up -d
```

This will start the container in detached mode (```-d```), which means it runs in the background. You can then connect to the MS SQL Server using your favorite database client, such as Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio or Azure Data Studio, using the following connection string:makefile
```makefile
Server=localhost,1433;Database=master;User Id=sa;Password=YourStrongPasswordHere;
```

And that's it! You now have a running MS SQL Server instance running in a Docker container that you can use for your development or testing needs.

--------
**You**: show a dotnet core  console project to connect mssql sample

--------
**ChatGPT**: Certainly! Here is a simple .NET Core console application that connects to the MS SQL Server instance we created in the previous example:First, create a new .NET Core console application by running the following command:javascript
```javascript
dotnet new console -n MyDatabaseApp
```

This will create a new console application project named ```MyDatabaseApp```.Next, add the ```Microsoft.Data.SqlClient``` NuGet package to the project by running the following command:java
```java
dotnet add package Microsoft.Data.SqlClient
```

This package provides a lightweight and efficient SQL Server client library for .NET Core applications.Replace the contents of the ```Program.cs``` file with the following code:csharp
```csharp
using System;
using Microsoft.Data.SqlClient;

namespace MyDatabaseApp
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Define the connection string
            string connectionString = "Server=localhost,1433;Database=master;User Id=sa;Password=YourStrongPasswordHere;";

            // Create a new SqlConnection object
            using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
            {
                try
                {
                    // Open the database connection
                    connection.Open();

                    // Execute a sample query
                    string query = "SELECT @@VERSION";
                    using (SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand(query, connection))
                    {
                        using (SqlDataReader reader = command.ExecuteReader())
                        {
                            // Read the query results
                            while (reader.Read())
                            {
                                Console.WriteLine(reader.GetString(0));
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
                catch (Exception ex)
                {
                    // Handle any errors
                    Console.WriteLine("Error: " + ex.Message);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Replace the ```YourStrongPasswordHere``` placeholder in the connection string with the actual SA password you set in the ```docker-compose.yml``` file.

Run the application by running the following command in the project directory:```dotnet run
```

This should connect to the MS SQL Server instance running in the Docker container and execute a sample query to retrieve the version information of the server. The query results should be displayed in the console window.
