**You**: can you show me a example for using k8s ingress?

--------
**ChatGPT**: Sure! Here's an example of using Kubernetes Ingress to expose an HTTP server running inside a Kubernetes cluster.

First, create a deployment and a service to run your HTTP server. For example:yaml
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: http-server
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: http-server
  replicas: 3
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: http-server
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: http-server
        image: my-http-server-image:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: http-server
spec:
  selector:
    app: http-server
  ports:
  - name: http
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
```

Next, create an Ingress resource to expose your HTTP server to the internet. For example:yaml
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: http-server-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
spec:
  rules:
  - host: example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /http-server
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: http-server
            port:
              name: http
```

In this example, the Ingress resource routes incoming requests to the HTTP server's Service based on the URL path. Requests to ```example.com/http-server``` will be routed to the ```http-server``` Service.

Note that the ```nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target``` annotation is used to strip the URL prefix (```/http-server```) from the request before it is sent to the HTTP server. This is because the HTTP server is not expecting the prefix in its URLs.

Finally, create a DNS record for your domain name to point to the IP address of your Kubernetes cluster's load balancer. Once the DNS record has propagated, you should be able to access your HTTP server at ```http://example.com/http-server```.

**You**: continue

**ChatGPT**: Assuming you have already deployed your Ingress resource, you can verify that it's working by checking the status of the Ingress resource using the ```kubectl``` command-line tool:css
```css
$ kubectl get ingress http-server-ingress
NAME                    CLASS    HOSTS         ADDRESS         PORTS   AGE
http-server-ingress     &lt;none&gt;   example.com   203.0.113.10   80      1m
```

This command will show you the current status of your Ingress resource, including its hostname, IP address, and port.

Next, you can test your Ingress resource by sending an HTTP request to it using a tool like ```curl```:ruby
```ruby
$ curl http://example.com/http-server
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should receive a response from your HTTP server.

Note that if you are running your Kubernetes cluster on a cloud provider, you may need to configure a load balancer or external IP address for your Ingress resource. Consult your cloud provider's documentation for more information.

That's it! With Kubernetes Ingress, you can easily expose your HTTP services to the internet and route incoming requests to the appropriate backend services based on URL paths or other criteria.
