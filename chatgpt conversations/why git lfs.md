**You**: why git lfs

**ChatGPT**: Git LFS (Large File Storage) is a Git extension that improves handling of large files by storing them outside of the Git repository on a remote server. Instead of storing the entire file in the Git repository, Git LFS stores a pointer to the file on the remote server. This allows for faster clone and fetch operations, as well as more efficient use of disk space. It also allows to track the files versions, the same way the other files that are tracked. This is particularly useful for working with large binary files, such as video and audio files, as well as large data sets.
