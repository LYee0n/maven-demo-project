# Build k8s from scratch.

## User
do you know how to build k8s?

## ChatGPT
Yes, Kubernetes (also known as k8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform that enables the automation and management of containerized applications. Building Kubernetes from scratch can be a complex task and requires significant expertise in software engineering, distributed systems, and containerization.

If you're looking to build Kubernetes from source code, you can follow the official documentation on the Kubernetes GitHub repository: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/devel/README.md

The Kubernetes project provides comprehensive documentation on building, testing, and deploying Kubernetes. The documentation includes detailed instructions for building Kubernetes from source code, including prerequisites, building and testing the code, and building and publishing Kubernetes binaries.

Keep in mind that building Kubernetes from source code is a complex task and requires significant knowledge of distributed systems, containerization, and software engineering. Therefore, it's usually not recommended for beginners or those without a deep understanding of these concepts.

I mean build k8s production enviroment from zero maybe have VM

## ChatGPT
Building a production-ready Kubernetes environment from scratch can be a complex task that involves multiple steps, including setting up a cluster of virtual machines (VMs), installing Kubernetes components, configuring networking, and deploying and managing containerized applications. Here's a general overview of the steps involved:

1. Choose a container runtime: Kubernetes requires a container runtime to manage containerized applications. Popular choices include Docker, containerd, and CRI-O.

2. Provision virtual machines: You can provision VMs using a cloud provider like AWS, GCP, or Azure, or you can use a local virtualization solution like VirtualBox or VMware. You'll need to create a cluster of VMs that will serve as the nodes in your Kubernetes cluster.

3. Install Kubernetes components: You'll need to install the Kubernetes components on each node in your cluster, including the kubelet, kube-proxy, kube-apiserver, kube-controller-manager, and kube-scheduler. You can either install these components manually or use a tool like kubeadm to automate the installation process.

4. Configure networking: Kubernetes requires a network overlay to enable communication between pods running on different nodes in the cluster. Popular choices include Calico, Flannel, and Weave Net.

5. Deploy and manage applications: Once your Kubernetes cluster is up and running, you can deploy and manage containerized applications using Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts. You can also use tools like kubectl or Kubernetes dashboard to manage your applications.

Keep in mind that building a production-ready Kubernetes environment can be a complex task that requires a deep understanding of Kubernetes concepts and best practices. It's often recommended to use a managed Kubernetes service like AWS EKS, GCP GKE, or Azure AKS, which can simplify the process of deploying and managing Kubernetes clusters in a production environment.

is there script to build basic k8s enviroment?

## ChatGPT
Yes, there are several scripts and tools available that can help automate the process of building a basic Kubernetes environment. Here are a few popular options:

1. kubeadm: kubeadm is a tool for bootstrapping a Kubernetes cluster that automates the installation and configuration of Kubernetes components on each node in the cluster. kubeadm provides a simple way to create a basic Kubernetes cluster on top of VMs or physical machines. You can find more information about using kubeadm in the official Kubernetes documentation: https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/

2. Kubespray: Kubespray is a popular open-source tool for deploying Kubernetes clusters on VMs or bare-metal servers. Kubespray uses Ansible to automate the installation and configuration of Kubernetes components and includes support for a wide range of cloud providers and operating systems. You can find more information about Kubespray on the project's GitHub page: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray

3. kops: kops is a tool for creating, upgrading, and managing Kubernetes clusters on AWS. kops automates the process of provisioning AWS resources, such as EC2 instances, VPCs, and security groups, and configures Kubernetes components using the latest best practices. You can find more information about kops on the project's GitHub page: https://github.com/kubernetes/kops

Keep in mind that these tools can help automate the process of building a basic Kubernetes environment, but you'll still need to have a good understanding of Kubernetes concepts and best practices to configure and manage your cluster effectively.

how about microk8s?

## ChatGPT
MicroK8s is a lightweight, fast, and secure Kubernetes distribution designed for developers, IoT, and edge computing use cases. MicroK8s is easy to install, requires minimal configuration, and can be deployed on a single machine or across multiple nodes. MicroK8s is developed and maintained by Canonical, the company behind Ubuntu Linux.

MicroK8s provides a convenient way to quickly set up a Kubernetes environment for development or testing purposes. With MicroK8s, you can quickly deploy and manage containerized applications using Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts. MicroK8s includes many popular Kubernetes add-ons, including Istio, Knative, and Fluentd.

To install MicroK8s, you can follow the official documentation on the MicroK8s website: https://microk8s.io/docs

Once MicroK8s is installed, you can use the standard Kubernetes tooling, including kubectl, to manage your cluster and deploy applications.

Keep in mind that MicroK8s is designed for lightweight and fast deployments, and may not be suitable for production use cases that require high availability, scalability, and advanced networking features. However, MicroK8s can be a great option for development, testing, and experimentation with Kubernetes.
