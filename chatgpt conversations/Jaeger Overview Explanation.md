# Jaeger Overview Explanation
**You**: do you know Jaeger?

--------
**ChatGPT**: Yes, I'm familiar with Jaeger. Jaeger is an open-source, end-to-end distributed tracing system, developed by Uber Technologies. It is used to monitor and troubleshoot microservices-based applications in distributed systems. Jaeger allows tracing requests as they flow through a microservices architecture, providing developers with insights into request latency, errors, and dependencies between services.

--------
**You**: how to integrate it with java spring?

--------
**ChatGPT**: To integrate Jaeger with a Java Spring application, you can follow these steps:Add the Jaeger dependency to your Maven or Gradle project. You can add the following to your ```pom.xml``` file if you're using Maven:

```php-template
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.jaegertracing</groupId>
    <artifactId>jaeger-client</artifactId>
    <version>1.19.0</version>
</dependency>
```

And the following to your ```build.gradle``` file if you're using Gradle:
```python
dependencies {
    implementation 'io.jaegertracing:jaeger-client:1.19.0'
}
```
Create a configuration class to configure the Jaeger tracer. You can add the following code to set up the tracer:kotlin
```kotlin
import io.jaegertracing.Configuration;
import io.opentracing.Tracer;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

@Configuration
public class JaegerConfig {
    @Bean
    public Tracer jaegerTracer() {
        return Configuration.fromEnv().getTracer();
    }
}
```
Use the ```Tracer``` bean in your Spring components to create spans. You can use the following code to create a span:java
```java
import io.opentracing.Span;
import io.opentracing.Tracer;

@Component
public class SomeService {
    private final Tracer tracer;

    @Autowired
    public SomeService(Tracer tracer) {
        this.tracer = tracer;
    }

    public void doWork() {
        Span span = tracer.buildSpan("doWork").start();
        try {
            // Do some work
        } finally {
            span.finish();
        }
    }
}
```
Start your Spring application with the following environment variables to configure the Jaeger collector:makefile
```makefile
JAEGER_AGENT_HOST=<hostname or IP of your Jaeger agent>
JAEGER_AGENT_PORT=<port of your Jaeger agent>
JAEGER_SERVICE_NAME=<your service name>
```

With these steps, you should be able to see trace data from your Spring application in the Jaeger UI.

--------
**You**: how to build it with docker compsoe?

--------
**ChatGPT**: You can use Docker Compose to build and run a Jaeger stack, which typically consists of the following components:

Jaeger Collector: This component is responsible for receiving and storing trace data.

Jaeger Query: This component provides a UI and API for searching and retrieving trace data.

Jaeger Agent: This component is responsible for receiving trace data from instrumented applications and forwarding it to the collector.

Here's an example ```docker-compose.yml``` file to set up a Jaeger stack using Docker Compose:yaml
```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  jaeger-collector:
    image: jaegertracing/jaeger-collector:1.19.0
    ports:
      - 14268:14268
      - 14250:14250
    environment:
      SPAN_STORAGE_TYPE: "elasticsearch"

  jaeger-query:
    image: jaegertracing/jaeger-query:1.19.0
    ports:
      - 16686:16686
    environment:
      SPAN_STORAGE_TYPE: "elasticsearch"
      ES_HOSTS: "http://jaeger-collector:14268"

  jaeger-agent:
    image: jaegertracing/jaeger-agent:1.19.0
    ports:
      - 5775:5775/udp
      - 6831:6831/udp
      - 6832:6832/udp
    environment:
      JAEGER_COLLECTOR_HOST: "jaeger-collector"
```

With this ```docker-compose.yml``` file, you can start the Jaeger stack using the following command:```docker-compose up
```

Once the stack is up and running, you can access the Jaeger UI at ```http://localhost:16686``` and send trace data to the Jaeger agent at ```localhost:5775```.

--------
**You**: is it have built-in elasticsearch?

--------
**ChatGPT**: Yes, Jaeger provides built-in support for storing trace data in Elasticsearch. When you set the ```SPAN_STORAGE_TYPE``` environment variable to ```elasticsearch```, the Jaeger Collector and Query components will use Elasticsearch as the backend for storing and retrieving trace data.

Here's an example of how you can set the ```SPAN_STORAGE_TYPE``` environment variable in a ```docker-compose.yml``` file:yaml
```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  jaeger-collector:
    image: jaegertracing/jaeger-collector:1.19.0
    ports:
      - 14268:14268
      - 14250:14250
    environment:
      SPAN_STORAGE_TYPE: "elasticsearch"

  jaeger-query:
    image: jaegertracing/jaeger-query:1.19.0
    ports:
      - 16686:16686
    environment:
      SPAN_STORAGE_TYPE: "elasticsearch"
      ES_HOSTS: "http://jaeger-collector:14268"

  jaeger-agent:
    image: jaegertracing/jaeger-agent:1.19.0
    ports:
      - 5775:5775/udp
      - 6831:6831/udp
      - 6832:6832/udp
    environment:
      JAEGER_COLLECTOR_HOST: "jaeger-collector"
```

With this setup, the Jaeger Collector will receive trace data from the Jaeger Agent and store it in an instance of Elasticsearch. The Jaeger Query component will then retrieve the trace data from Elasticsearch and provide a UI and API for searching and visualizing the trace data.

--------
**You**: how to integrate with external elasticsearch in same docker compose?

--------
**ChatGPT**: You can use an external Elasticsearch instance with your Jaeger stack by running an Elasticsearch container and specifying the host and port in the ```ES_HOSTS``` environment variable for the Jaeger Query component.

Here's an example ```docker-compose.yml``` file that shows how you can integrate an external Elasticsearch instance with your Jaeger stack using Docker Compose:yaml
```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  jaeger-collector:
    image: jaegertracing/jaeger-collector:1.19.0
    ports:
      - 14268:14268
      - 14250:14250
    environment:
      SPAN_STORAGE_TYPE: "elasticsearch"

  jaeger-query:
    image: jaegertracing/jaeger-query:1.19.0
    ports:
      - 16686:16686
    environment:
      SPAN_STORAGE_TYPE: "elasticsearch"
      ES_HOSTS: "http://elasticsearch:9200"

  jaeger-agent:
    image: jaegertracing/jaeger-agent:1.19.0
    ports:
      - 5775:5775/udp
      - 6831:6831/udp
      - 6832:6832/udp
    environment:
      JAEGER_COLLECTOR_HOST: "jaeger-collector"

  elasticsearch:
    image: docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.9.2
    ports:
      - 9200:9200
      - 9300:9300
```

In this example, the ```elasticsearch``` service runs an instance of Elasticsearch and exposes ports 9200 and 9300. The ```jaeger-query``` service then uses the ```ES_HOSTS``` environment variable to connect to the external Elasticsearch instance at ```http://elasticsearch:9200```. The Jaeger Collector will receive trace data from the Jaeger Agent and store it in the external Elasticsearch instance.

You can start the stack with the following command:
```
docker-compose up
```

Once the stack is up and running, you can access the Jaeger UI at ```http://localhost:16686``` and send trace data to the Jaeger agent at ```localhost:5775```. The trace data will be stored in the external Elasticsearch instance and can be retrieved and visualized through the Jaeger UI.

--------
**You**: can you show me some Jaeger UI image?

--------
**ChatGPT**: I'm sorry, I am a text-based AI language model and do not have the capability to display images. However, here's a description of what you might see in the Jaeger UI:

The Jaeger UI provides a visual representation of the trace data that has been collected by the Jaeger collector. The main page of the Jaeger UI displays a list of trace summaries, each of which provides a high-level view of a trace and its spans.

When you click on a trace summary, you are taken to a trace detail page that displays a timeline view of the trace, showing each span in the trace and its relationships to other spans. The timeline view provides a visual representation of the flow of a request through your system, allowing you to see how long each span took, which services were involved, and how data was passed from one service to another.

The trace detail page also provides detailed information about each span, including its start and end times, operation name, tags, and logs. You can use this information to understand what happened during the trace, identify errors and slowdowns, and diagnose performance issues.

In addition to the timeline view, the Jaeger UI also provides a search page that allows you to search for traces by service, operation name, tag, and time range. You can use this page to find specific traces and get an overview of the performance and behavior of your system.
