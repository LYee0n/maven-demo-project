**You**: show me some mssql common ddl

--------
**ChatGPT**: Sure! Here are some common Data Definition Language (DDL) statements that are frequently used in Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL):CREATE TABLE: This statement is used to create a new table in the database. It specifies the table name, the columns of the table, and their data types. Here's an example:sql
```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name VARCHAR(50),
  last_name VARCHAR(50),
  hire_date DATE,
  salary DECIMAL(10,2)
);
```ALTER TABLE: This statement is used to modify an existing table in the database. It can be used to add, modify or delete columns or constraints. Here's an example:sql
```sql
ALTER TABLE employees
ADD middle_name VARCHAR(50);
```DROP TABLE: This statement is used to delete an existing table in the database. It permanently removes the table and all its data. Here's an example:sql
```sql
DROP TABLE employees;
```CREATE INDEX: This statement is used to create an index on one or more columns in a table. Indexes can improve the performance of queries by making it faster to search for specific data. Here's an example:arduino
```arduino
CREATE INDEX idx_employees_last_name
ON employees (last_name);
```ALTER INDEX: This statement is used to modify an existing index on a table. It can be used to change the name of an index, add or remove columns from the index, or change the index type. Here's an example:graphql
```graphql
ALTER INDEX idx_employees_last_name
ON employees
REBUILD;
```

These are just a few examples of the many DDL statements available in MSSQL. Each statement has its own syntax and options, so it's important to consult the documentation or seek expert advice before using them in production environments.

**You**: show me more different data type

--------
**ChatGPT**: Sure! Here are some more data types that are available in Microsoft SQL Server:

CHAR: This data type is used to store fixed-length character strings. It can store up to 8,000 characters.

VARCHAR: This data type is used to store variable-length character strings. It can store up to 8,000 characters.

TEXT: This data type is used to store large character strings. It can store up to 2^31-1 bytes.

NCHAR: This data type is used to store fixed-length Unicode character strings. It can store up to 4,000 characters.

NVARCHAR: This data type is used to store variable-length Unicode character strings. It can store up to 4,000 characters.

NTEXT: This data type is used to store large Unicode character strings. It can store up to 2^30-1 bytes.

INT: This data type is used to store whole numbers. It can store values between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647.

BIGINT: This data type is used to store large whole numbers. It can store values between -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 and 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.

FLOAT: This data type is used to store floating-point numbers. It can store values between -1.79E+308 and 1.79E+308.

DECIMAL: This data type is used to store fixed-point numbers. It can store up to 38 digits of precision.

These are just a few examples of the many data types available in Microsoft SQL Server. Each data type has its own characteristics, such as size, precision, and range, and it's important to choose the appropriate data type for each column in your database to ensure efficient storage and retrieval of data.

**You**: and there example ddl

--------
**ChatGPT**: Sure! Here are some examples of DDL statements that use the data types I mentioned earlier:CHAR and VARCHAR:sql
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  password CHAR(64) NOT NULL
);
```

This statement creates a table named "users" with three columns: "id", "username", and "password". The "username" and "password" columns are both character strings, but "username" is defined as a VARCHAR with a maximum length of 50 characters, while "password" is defined as a CHAR with a fixed length of 64 characters.TEXT:sql
```sql
CREATE TABLE posts (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  content TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

This statement creates a table named "posts" with three columns: "id", "title", and "content". The "content" column is defined as a large character string using the TEXT data type, which allows it to store up to 2^31-1 bytes of data.INT and BIGINT:sql
```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
  id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_id INT NOT NULL,
  order_date DATETIME NOT NULL
);
```

This statement creates a table named "orders" with three columns: "id", "customer_id", and "order_date". The "id" column is defined as a BIGINT, which allows it to store large whole numbers, while "customer_id" is defined as an INT, which is suitable for storing smaller whole numbers.FLOAT:sql
```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  price FLOAT(6,2) NOT NULL
);
```

This statement creates a table named "products" with three columns: "id", "name", and "price". The "price" column is defined as a FLOAT with a precision of 6 and a scale of 2, which means it can store up to six digits with two digits after the decimal point.DECIMAL:sql
```sql
CREATE TABLE accounts (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  account_number VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
  balance DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL
);
```

This statement creates a table named "accounts" with three columns: "id", "account_number", and "balance". The "balance" column is defined as a DECIMAL with a precision of 10 and a scale of 2, which means it can store up to 10 digits with two digits after the decimal point.

--------
**You**: how about auto increament id

--------
**ChatGPT**: Sure! You can create an auto-incrementing ID column in Microsoft SQL Server using the IDENTITY property. Here's an example:sql
```sql
CREATE TABLE my_table (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY,
  name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  age INT NOT NULL
);
```

In this example, the "id" column is defined as an INT and is marked as the primary key using the PRIMARY KEY keyword. The IDENTITY property is then used to specify that the values in the "id" column should be automatically generated and incremented for each new row inserted into the table.

When a new row is inserted into the table, SQL Server will automatically assign a unique ID value to the "id" column based on the last assigned value, and then increment the value for the next insertion.

Note that the IDENTITY property can only be applied to a single column in a table, and the column must be defined as a numeric data type (such as INT or BIGINT). Additionally, you cannot explicitly insert values into an IDENTITY column, as the values are generated automatically by SQL Server.
