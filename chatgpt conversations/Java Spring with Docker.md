**You**: how to build java spring app with docker compose deploy by ansible and secret from vault?

--------
**ChatGPT**: To build a Java Spring app with Docker Compose and deploy it using Ansible, and retrieve secrets from Vault, you can follow these steps:Build your Java Spring appCreate your Java Spring application using your preferred IDE or build tool, such as Maven or Gradle.Ensure that your application can be packaged as a Docker image.Write a Dockerfile that specifies the environment and dependencies needed to run your application.Create a Docker Compose fileWrite a Docker Compose file that describes your application, its dependencies, and any environment variables that your application needs to run.Ensure that your Docker Compose file specifies the Docker image that you created in step 1.Store secrets in VaultStore any secrets that your application needs, such as passwords or API keys, in Vault.Ensure that your Ansible playbook can access Vault by configuring Vault authentication.Write an Ansible playbookWrite an Ansible playbook that uses the Docker Compose module to deploy your application.Ensure that your playbook retrieves any secrets from Vault and passes them as environment variables to your Docker containers.Test and deploy your applicationTest your Ansible playbook on a development or staging environment.Once you are satisfied with your playbook, deploy your application to your production environment using Ansible.

Here is an example playbook that uses the Docker Compose module to deploy a Java Spring app with secrets from Vault:yaml
```yaml
- hosts: myapp
  tasks:
    - name: Retrieve secrets from Vault
      hashi_vault:
        path: secret/myapp
        key: password
        register: vault_secret

    - name: Deploy Docker Compose
      docker_compose:
        project_name: myapp
        definition:
          version: '3'
          services:
            app:
              image: myapp:latest
              environment:
                - PASSWORD={{ vault_secret['password'] }}
              ports:
                - "8080:8080"
              restart: always
      vars:
        DOCKER_COMPOSE_VERSION: 1.29.2
        DOCKER_API_VERSION: 1.41
      become: yes
```

In this playbook, we first retrieve the ```password``` secret from the ```secret/myapp``` path in Vault. We then pass this secret as an environment variable named ```PASSWORD``` to our Docker container using the ```docker_compose``` module. We also specify the ```DOCKER_COMPOSE_VERSION``` and ```DOCKER_API_VERSION``` variables, which tell Ansible which versions of Docker Compose and the Docker API to use.

This is just a simple example, and you may need to customize this playbook to suit your specific needs.
