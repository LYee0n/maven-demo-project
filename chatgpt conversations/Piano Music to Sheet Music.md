# Piano Music to Sheet Music
**You**: do you know how to implement convert a piano music to sheet music

**ChatGPT**: Yes, converting a piano performance into sheet music can be achieved using a software process called Music OCR (Optical Character Recognition). Here's how it works:

Record the piano performance: You can record the audio of the piano performance using a digital audio recorder or smartphone.

Convert the audio to a MIDI file: This step involves using software to transcribe the audio into a MIDI file, which contains data about the notes played and their timing information.

Run Music OCR on the MIDI file: In this step, you use a specialized software tool that reads the MIDI data and generates sheet music from it. This software analyses the MIDI file, determines what notes were played and at what times, and converts that information into musical notation.

Edit the sheet music: After generating the sheet music, you may need to make manual adjustments to fix any errors or to improve the appearance of the score.

There are several software programs available that can perform this process, such as PhotoScore, SharpEye, and Notation Musician. These programs can produce sheet music that is very close to the original performance, but it is important to note that some errors may still occur and will require manual correction.

**You**: is there any open source software Convert the audio to a MIDI file

**ChatGPT**: Yes, there are open source software options for converting audio to MIDI. Some popular open source options include:

Audacity: Audacity is a free, open-source digital audio editor and recording application that can be used to record and export audio files. It also has a plugin called "NoteTrack Pro" that can be used to transcribe audio to MIDI.

Sonic Visualiser: Sonic Visualiser is a free, open-source application for viewing and analyzing the contents of music audio files. It also has a feature that allows you to transcribe audio to MIDI.

LMMS: LMMS is a free, open-source digital audio workstation that can be used to produce music. It has a built-in feature that allows you to transcribe audio to MIDI.

It's worth noting that the quality of the transcription will depend on the quality of the audio recording and the software used. Some errors may still occur, so manual correction may be necessary.
