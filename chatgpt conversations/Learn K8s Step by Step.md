# Learn K8s Step by Step
**You**: can you teach me k8s step by step?

--------
**ChatGPT**: Yes, I can certainly help you learn Kubernetes step by step. Here is a general outline of the steps you can follow to get started with Kubernetes:

Familiarize yourself with the basic concepts of Kubernetes: Before you start using Kubernetes, it is important to understand its architecture and the core concepts such as nodes, pods, services, replicasets, etc.

Set up a development environment: To get hands-on experience with Kubernetes, you'll need to set up a development environment. You can either set up a local environment using tools like Minikube or use a cloud-based solution like Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) or Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).

Deploy your first application: Once you have your development environment set up, the next step is to deploy your first application. You can use YAML files to define your application components and use the ```kubectl``` command-line tool to deploy and manage your applications.

Explore advanced features: Once you have deployed your first application, you can explore advanced features of Kubernetes such as scaling, self-healing, rolling updates, and configuration management.

Learn about Kubernetes networking: To fully understand how Kubernetes works, it's important to understand its networking model. This includes understanding how pods communicate with each other and how to expose services to the external network.

Debugging and troubleshooting: Finally, you should learn about common debugging and troubleshooting techniques for Kubernetes, such as using logs and metrics, and understanding error messages.

These are the general steps you can follow to get started with Kubernetes. As you gain more experience, you can explore more advanced topics such as security, performance optimization, and custom resource definitions (CRDs).

--------
**You**: can you show me excutable script for each step?

--------
**ChatGPT**: Sure, here's a script that you can use to deploy a simple application on a local Kubernetes cluster using Minikube:

Step 1: Start Minikubesql
```sql
minikube start
```

Step 2: Deploy a simple application

Create a file named ```nginx.yml``` with the following content:yaml
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

Use the following command to create the deployment:```kubectl apply -f nginx.yml
```

Step 3: Expose the deployment as a service

Create a file named ```nginx-service.yml``` with the following content:yaml
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
  - name: http
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
  type: NodePort
```

Use the following command to create the service:```kubectl apply -f nginx-service.yml
```

Step 4: Access the application

Use the following command to get the URL to access the application:css
```css
minikube service nginx-service --url
```

You should see an output similar to the following:javascript
```javascript
http://192.168.99.100:32111
```

You can use a web browser to access the URL and see the default Nginx landing page.

This is just a simple example of how you can use a script to deploy an application on a local Kubernetes cluster. You can use a similar approach to deploy applications on a cloud-based Kubernetes cluster like GKE or EKS, but you will need to modify the script based on the specific requirements of the cluster.

--------
**You**: how can I get these nginx logs?

--------
**ChatGPT**: You can get the logs of the Nginx containers running in your Kubernetes cluster using the ```kubectl logs``` command.

Here's an example of how you can get the logs for a specific container:php
```php-template
kubectl logs &lt;pod_name&gt; -c nginx
```

In this example, ```&lt;pod_name&gt;``` is the name of the pod that is running the Nginx container and ```-c nginx``` specifies the name of the container. You can use the ```kubectl get pods``` command to get a list of all the pods in your cluster and find the name of the pod that is running the Nginx container.

Alternatively, you can get logs for all containers in a pod using the following command:php
```php-template
kubectl logs &lt;pod_name&gt;
```

Note that this will give you the logs for all containers in the pod, not just the Nginx container.

--------
**You**: can I get into these pod with ssh?

--------
**ChatGPT**: In Kubernetes, pods are ephemeral and are intended to be replaced if they fail or if you need to update the application. By design, pods do not have a persistent IP address or file system, so you cannot use SSH to directly log into a pod.

However, you can use the ```kubectl exec``` command to execute commands in a container within a pod. For example, the following command will open a shell in the Nginx container:python
```python
kubectl exec -it &lt;pod_name&gt; -c nginx -- /bin/bash
```

In this example, ```&lt;pod_name&gt;``` is the name of the pod that is running the Nginx container and ```-c nginx``` specifies the name of the container. You can use the ```kubectl get pods``` command to get a list of all the pods in your cluster and find the name of the pod that is running the Nginx container.

--------
**You**: how can I do the same deploy with helm?

--------
**ChatGPT**: Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that makes it easier to deploy, manage, and upgrade complex applications. With Helm, you can package your application as a Helm chart, which is a collection of files that describe your application and its dependencies.

Here's an example of how you can deploy the same Nginx application that we deployed earlier using Helm:

Step 1: Install Helm

You'll need to have Helm installed on your system to use it. You can find the instructions for installing Helm on the official Helm website.

Step 2: Initialize Helm

Once you have Helm installed, you need to initialize the Helm CLI and set up the local environment:csharp
```csharp
helm init
```

Step 3: Create a chart

Create a directory for the chart, for example:bash
```bash
mkdir nginx-chart
cd nginx-chart
```

Use the following command to create the chart:lua
```lua
helm create .
```

This will create a basic chart structure with a set of default files.

Step 4: Edit the chart

Edit the ```templates/deployment.yaml``` file to look like this:yaml
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: {{ .Release.Name }}-nginx
  labels:
    app: {{ .Release.Name }}-nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: {{ .Release.Name }}-nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: {{ .Release.Name }}-nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

Edit the ```templates/service.yaml``` file to look like this:yaml
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: {{ .Release.Name }}-nginx
  labels:
    app: {{ .Release.Name }}-nginx
spec:
  selector:
    app: {{ .Release.Name }}-nginx
  ports:
  - name: http
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
  type: NodePort
```

Step 5: Package and install the chart

Use the following command to package the chart:java
```java
helm package .
```

This will create a tar file with the chart, for example ```nginx-chart-0.1.0.tgz```.

Use the following command to install the chart:```helm install nginx-chart-0.1.0.tgz
```

This will install the Nginx chart on your cluster.

Step 6: Access the application

Use the following command to get the URL to access the application:css
```css
minikube service &lt;release_name&gt;-nginx --url
```

Replace ```&lt;release_name&gt;``` with the name of the release, which you can find using the ```helm list``` command.

You should see an output similar to the following:javascript
```javascript
http://192.168.99.100:32111
```

You can use a web browser to access the URL and see the default Nginx landing page.

This is just a basic example of how
