**You**: show me how to build vault with docker compose then put first secret and get with curl

--------
**ChatGPT**: Sure, I can guide you through building a Vault instance using Docker Compose, adding your first secret, and retrieving it with curl. Here are the steps:Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it:bash
```bash
mkdir vault-demo
cd vault-demo
```Create a file called ```docker-compose.yml``` in this directory and add the following content:yaml
```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  vault:
    image: vault
    container_name: vault
    ports:
      - "8200:8200"
    environment:
      VAULT_DEV_ROOT_TOKEN_ID: "root"
      VAULT_ADDR: "http://vault:8200"
```

This defines a single service called ```vault``` that uses the official ```vault``` Docker image, exposes port 8200, and sets some environment variables needed to run Vault in development mode.Start the service with Docker Compose:```docker-compose up -d
```Once the service is up and running, you can interact with the Vault instance using the Vault CLI. First, authenticate to the instance using the root token that was automatically generated when you started the container:python
```python
docker-compose exec vault vault login root
```Now, you can add your first secret to the Vault instance. For example, let's add a secret called ```mysecret``` with the value ```myvalue```:bash
```bash
docker-compose exec vault vault kv put secret/mysecret value=myvalue
```You can now retrieve this secret using curl. First, export the root token as an environment variable:javascript
```javascript
export VAULT_TOKEN=root
```Then, use curl to retrieve the secret:bash
```bash
curl -H "X-Vault-Token: $VAULT_TOKEN" http://localhost:8200/v1/secret/data/mysecret | jq '.data.data'
```

This should output the value of the ```mysecret``` secret, which is ```myvalue```.

That's it! You have now set up a Vault instance with Docker Compose, added your first secret, and retrieved it using curl.

--------
**You**: put with curl

--------
**ChatGPT**: Sure! You can use the ```curl``` command to add a secret to a Vault instance using the HTTP API. Here's an example:Export your Vault token as an environment variable. Replace ```YOUR_TOKEN_HERE``` with your actual token:javascript
```javascript
export VAULT_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```Create a JSON file that contains the secret data you want to store. For example, you could create a file called ```secret.json``` with the following content:json
```json
{
  "data": {
    "username": "myuser",
    "password": "mypassword"
  }
}
```

This JSON file specifies a secret with two fields: ```username``` and ```password```.Use the ```curl``` command to add the secret to Vault. Replace ```VAULT_ADDRESS_HERE``` with the address of your Vault instance, and ```SECRET_PATH_HERE``` with the path where you want to store the secret (e.g. ```secret/myapp/db```):bash
```bash
curl \
  --header "X-Vault-Token: $VAULT_TOKEN" \
  --request POST \
  --data @secret.json \
  $VAULT_ADDRESS_HERE/v1/SECRET_PATH_HERE
```If the secret is successfully added, you should see output similar to the following:json
```json
{
  "request_id": "96ff2c8b-c2cb-2d38-a1b3-26f8c3b3faa3",
  "lease_id": "",
  "renewable": false,
  "lease_duration": 0,
  "data": null,
  "wrap_info": null,
  "warnings": null,
  "auth": null
}
```

The ```data``` field should be ```null```, which indicates that the secret was added successfully.

That's it! You have now added a secret to your Vault instance using ```curl```.
